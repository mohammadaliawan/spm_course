# Introduction to Software Product Management:

A philosophy for developing great software through effective handling of:
- Client Expectations
- Developer Expertise
- Time lines

### One Key challenge in Software Product Management

Managing Change is one of the key challenges involved in Software Development.

A software product is refined into a state of usability with ideas and feedback from everyone involved specially the client and end users.

### Role of a Software Product Manager

A Software Product Manager needs a unique set of skills to assess whether the product is meeting client expectations and to work with the development team to solve the clients problems.

## Three Goals to Achieve Better Software

Many people with different skill sets involved in building a great software product.

Software Product Manager needs to understand these different viewpoints to achieve better software

- Right Product for the clients
  = Meets their needs
  - Solves their problem
  - Doesnt Waste Time
  - UX and UI are easy to use and intuitive
  - Client is Happy

> End Result of this goal is {The Software Product is Validated}

- Software Product is Done Right
  - THe Requirements, Design and Implementation Aligned
    - Accomplished through Development Reviews and Tests.

> End Result of this goal is {The Software Product is Verified}

- Software Project is Managed Right

The Software Project is itself Managed right so that the above two goals are achieved. For this, we need to adopt enough processes and practices to organize the work of everyone involved. 

These Practices ease communication and feedback so that everyone is clear on the next steps.

> End Result of this goal is {The Project is Managed}

> **To Acheive Better software the three goals are:**
  - THe Right Product
  - Done Right
  - Managed Right

## Role of a Software Product Manager

- Success of the Software Product
- Can speak to both the client and the development tea, in their own terms.
- Understanding the product from the clients point of view
- Effective Communication and Motivation of Development Team Members

## Several Ways a Project can be deemed successfull

- On time Delivery
- Completed Within Budget
- To Specification i.e. Delivered with all features complete

Other Success Factors:

- The number of Post Release Bugs
- The Support needed after release
- Customer Rating
- Revenue Generated
- The Client's Satisfaction

The Product Manager will 
- identify attributes of Product and Project Success and 
- assign metrics to ensure that development is driving towards delivering a quality product.

## Core Values of Agile Manifesto

### What is Agile?

"Agile" meaning : having a quick, resourceful and adaptive character

> Agile is a set of software development principles created for effective and adaptive software development. 

These principles take shape as practices that have become commonly adopted in the software development industry.

### Four Core Values of Agile Philosophy

- Individuals and Interactions >> Processes and tools.
- Working Software >> Comprehensive Documentation.
- Customer Collaboration >> Contract Negotiation.
- Responding to Change >> Following a Plan.

The items on the left are more important things to focus on. Although items on the left still have value.

## 12 Principles of Agile Manifesto

Divided into three Categories:

### Delivering Working Software

1. Early and Continuous Delivery

Satisfy the Customer through early and continuos delivery of valuable software
That the client deems as valuable

2. Deliver Frequently

Deliver working software frequently, couple of weeks to couple of months, preference to shorter timescale

3. Working Prototypes as progress

Working Software is the primary measure of progress.

Working Software comprises those features that are complete i.e reviewed and tested.

### Flexible Design and Adapting to Change

1. Welcome Changing Requirements

Welcome changing requirements even latein the development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage

2. Techincal Excellence and Good Design

Continuos attention to technical excellence and good design enhance agility

3. Sustainable Development

Agile Processes promote sustainable development. 

The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely

4. Focus on Simplicity

Simplicity: the art of maximizing the amount of work not done is essential.

### Collaborative Communication and Organization

1. Build Projects around Motivated People

Give them the environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done.

2. Self Organizing Teams

The best architechures, requirements and designs emerge from teams

3. Daily Collaboration

Business people and developers must work togather daily throughout the project.

4. Encourage Face to Face Interation

The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face to face conversation.

5. Reflect on Team Behaviour

At regular intervals the team reflects on how to become more effective then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly.

### Benefits of Agile

Agile brings focus to ensuring a steady, manageable and efficient development pace. 

Agile practices encourage frequent testing and demonstrations. Helps to Reduce bugs and keep the client involved in the development process. 

Agile practices encourage communication with the client. 

Managing expectations is important. Keeping your client involved throughout the entire project allows them to see the product as it develops and give feedback. Ensures that the client gets what they asked for.
